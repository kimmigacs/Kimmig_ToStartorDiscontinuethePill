### **Analysis data and code for Kimmig et al.: "To start or to discontinue the pill â€“ changes in progestogens are reflected by resting-state connectivity and positive mood"**

Barcharts: R code and anonymized raw data provided. Running the scripts create and save the bar plot figures provided in the manuscript.

IS-RSAs: Three Jupyter Notebook files are provided for the different types of intersubject RSAs presented in the manuscript, including all output.txt files: 
1) hormonal change by parcel-wise resting state functional connectivity
2) hormonal change by behavioral change
3) parcel-wise resting state functional connectivity by behavioral change

Note: Step-wise use of the Jupyter Notebooks is required to select the specific dataframes (e.g. progestogens, estrogens, positive mood, negative mood, parcel wise connectivity etc.)
for the respective IS-RSA
